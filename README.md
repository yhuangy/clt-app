# Central Limit Theorem for sample means

This is a simple [ShinyApp](https://ythuangy-clt-app.share.connect.posit.cloud/) that demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through simulations.

### Features

+ Single sample: Generate a sample from a Normal or Bernoulli distribution with user-defined parameters.

+ Repeated sampling: Draw multiple samples, compute sample means, and visualize the sampling distribution.

+ Code display: See the (base) R code for sampling and plotting.

### Learning outcomes

+ Understand the Central Limit Theorem for sample means

+ Interpret the mean and standard error of a sampling distribution.

+ Connect theory to simulation outputs with reproducible R code.
